                <p> JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled and multi-paradigm. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation and first-class functions.
                </p>
                <center><h1>History of JavaScript language </h1></center>
                <p>
                    JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript.
                    </p>
                    <center><h1>Features of Javascript</h1></center>
                    The Statement Control Syntax System of Java Script is very similar to Statement Control Syntax used in C Language. Java Script allows more abilities to perform as HTML is only capable of designing websites and incapable of performing logic operations like condition checking, statements looping (while & for), statement decision making (else and if) at client edge and adding two numbers.
                    JavaScript is incapable of performing these functions which results in our need for JavaScript to execute these operations over the client edge. This scripting language can help to build more interactive websites, developing inbuilt clocks, light client edge programs, building windows popup with different dialog boxes like alerting dialog boxes, confirmation dialog boxes, and prompt dialog options.
                    Nowadays many web-based giants are using the technology of Java Script like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Gmail and Google Maps, etc. The Java Script features Enterprise level pop-down menus, Opening, and Closure of new window, manipulation of HTML Layers, Interface Enhancement of HTML, Adding animation essentials within the page, adding dynamic appearance in documents of HTML and Fixing of problems related to Browsers.
